    <h2>Movie Quote</h2>
      <p><i>We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.</i></p>
    <h2>Plot</h2>
      <p>SPOILER ALERT!</p>
      <p><span class="spoil-protect">In a not so distant future, the world is slowly starving and at the brink of collapse due to a seemingly incurable disease killing all food crops. Cooper, a former test pilot turned farmer, is recruited to pilot humanity's last ditch effort to find a new home. Through a newly discovered worm-hole, leading to another solar system with several potential planets for colonization, Cooper and his crew must decide which planet will be humanity's new home. With only one ship, if they choose wrong, it will be the end of the human species. Adding to his emotional turmoil, due to the nature of space travel, Cooper has to struggle with leaving his family and possibly never returning within their lifetime.</span></p>
